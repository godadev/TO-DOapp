# TO-DOapp
Nothing special. Just a basic To-Do application

A simple To-Do application that is meant to store the users To-Do list.
Current version doesnt yet support saving and is terminal only.
Futures included are Add, Show, Edit, Complete, Exit(x).

Planed is a terminal version, a Html(web) version and a Tkinter Gui version.
The terminal version will save to files or SqLite, others will save to a database (not decided yet).
